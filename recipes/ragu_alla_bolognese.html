<h2>Ingredients for 8 people</h2>
<h3>Tagliatelle</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>600 gr. flour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ragu alla Bolognese</h3>
<ul>
<li>350 gr. ground beef</li>
<li>150 gr. ground pork</li>
<li>100 gr. minced pancetta</li>
<li>1 celery stick</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 medium onion</li>
<li>1 cup of milk</li>
<li>1 cup of white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
<li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>meat broth or vegatable broth or water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for creating the best ragu ever!</h2>
<h3>The ragu</h3>
<ol>
<li>Chop the celery stick, the carrot and the onion all together
and fry them all lightly in the extra virgin olive oil together with the minced pancetta,
stirring every now and then so that they do not burn.</li>
<li>When the vegetables and the pancetta are cooked,
add the ground meat (both beef and pork) and cook at high fire until browned.</li>
<li>Add the wine and let it evaporate, then pour in the milk.</li>
<li>Add the tomato paste, salt and pepper. If the sauce is dry, add broth or water.</li>
<li>Cover and boil at very low fire for about 3 hours, stirring and checking every now and then if it gets dry.
In this case, add more broth or water.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The tagliatelle</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put the flour in a little heap on a wooden board and make a hole in the middle of the flour.</li>
<li>Break the eggs inside the hole.</li>
<li>Beat the eggs with a fork and, little by little,
incorporate the flour from the sides with a fork or spatula, mixing it well with the eggs.</li>
<li>When the dough becomes too hard, start working it with your hands.</li>
<li>Keep going until the dough is hard, but not sticky.</li>
<li>Knead the dough 10-15 minutes, until the dough gets smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>Let the dough rest by putting it under a ceramic dish or in a plastic bag. Rest for at least 15 minutes,
but the longer, the better.</li>
<li>After resting, roll the dough with a rolling pin until it is about 1-2 mm thick.
Roll it around a dryer to dry it, but be careful not to let it dry completely. Otherwise it will break.</li>
<li>When it is ready, roll the dough without crushing it so that it does not stick.</li>
<li>With a pasta knife, cut 6 mm wide strips and unroll about 6 strips each time,
rolling them around your hand to make the shape of a nest.</li>
<li>Put all the nests on a paper tray or on a dryer.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The marriage of pasta and ragu</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cook the tagliatelle in boiling salted water. If the tagliatelle are fresh, the cooking time is 1-2 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain the tagliatelle as soon as they float to the top of the pan.</li>
<li>Saute the pasta in a pan with abundant hot ragu, adding a handful of grated parmigiano reggiano cheese.</li>
<li>Fresh tagliatelle can be kept in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for 2 months.</li>
</ol>
