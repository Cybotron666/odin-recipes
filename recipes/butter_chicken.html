<ul>
<li>400 gr basmati rice</li>
<li>600 ml water (or enough to cover the rice)</li>
<li>pinch of kardamom</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chicken</h3>

<li>800 gr chicken thighs or breasts (preferably thighs)</li>
<li>10 tbps fresh yoghurt</li>
<li>1 tbps garam masala</li>
<li>2 tps ground cumin</li>
<li>2 tbps tumeric</li>
<li>2 tps cayennepepper</li>
<li>2 tps garlic powder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Curry sauce</h3>
<li>50 gr butter</li>
<li>2 medium-size onions</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves (or to taste)</li>
<li>1 tbps garam masala</li>
<li>4 stalks cilantro (leaves and stems)</li>
<li>400 ml tomato sauce or canned tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tbps creme fraiche</li>
<li>neutral oil, like sunflower or groundnut (*no olive oil*)</li>
<li>water as needed</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps for creating a delicious curry!</h2>
<h3>Preparing the chicken and veggies</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cut the chicken in pieces of approx. 3 cm. Be sure to cut them about equal in size.</li>
<li>Put the chicken pieces in a bowl. Mix with the garam masala, ground cumin, cayennepepper and garlic powder.</li>
<li>Add the yoghurt to the spiced chicken. Mix everything well.
Cover with foil and let it marinate in the fridge for at least an hour, but preferably overnight for better flavor.</li>
<li>When you're ready to start cooking, remove the chicken from the fridge and let it get to room temperature.
This should take about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Finely cut the onions and garlic.
For best results, push the garlic through a garlic press. Set aside.</li>
<li>For the cilantro, cut the leaves and stems into little pieces. Set aside in seperate bowl.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Making the rice and butter chicken</h3>
<ol>
<li>First wash the rice. Put the rice in a pan and add cold water,
enough to cover the rice. Mix thoroughly with your hands. Rinse through a fine sieve.
Repeat until the water is clear.</li>
<li>Put the washed rice in the pan and cover with water. The rice should be about 1 fingertip deep.</li>
<li>Place the pan on high heat and let it come to a boil.
When the rice starts to boil, lower heat to medium-low and place the lid so that steam can escape.
Start with the butter chicken, but keep an eye on the rice.
Remove the rice from the heat when it's almost done and cover with a lid.</li>
<li>Heat a large skillet to high heat.
Add the chicken pieces. While stirring continuously, cook until tender and well-done.
Remove from the skillet and set aside.
<li>Add some more oil to the skillet.
Turn down the heat to low-medium. Add the onions and garlic and cook for approx. 10-15 minutes. 
The onions and garlic should caramelize and get sweeter.
Take care not to burn the garlic.</li>
<li>Add the butter to the onions and garlic and stir until it is all melted.</li>
<li>Add the tomato sauce or canned tomatoes, breaking the tomatoes into small pieces if necessary.
Add the garam masala to the sauce. Stir well and cover with a lid, stirring every now and then.</li>
<li>When the curry has thickened somewhat, add the creme fraiche.
Stirring well, let it simmer for approx. 10 more minutes.</li>
<li>Taste the sauce and add salt and/or pepper as needed. Add the chicken pieces and stir.</li>
<li>Finally, add the cilantro (stems and leaves) to the butter chicken.
Cook for a few minutes until you can smell and taste the cilantro flavor.</li>
<li>Serve the butter chicken with the dry rice. Enjoy!</li>
<li><em><strong>For an even better result, warm up a few pre-made naan in the oven and serve with the butter chicken.
It's the best way to get all that delicious sauce off your plate!</strong></em></li>
